# Introduction

This repository contains the work undertaken by myself (Harrison Sweeney) as part of my final year thesis in Mechatronic Engineering at UWA, Australia. It involves analysing a text corpus of medical data containing symptoms, causes, treatments, and drugs to identify relations between extracted data points. This information is then stored in a graph database (Neo4j), where is is able to be queried and manipulated. Down the line, an iOS app will be developed to interact with the graph database.
